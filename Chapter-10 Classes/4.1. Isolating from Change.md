- Needs will change, therefore code will change. We learned in OO 101 that there are con-crete classes, which contain implementation details (code), and abstract classes, which represent concepts only. A client class depending upon concrete details is at risk when those details change. We can introduce interfaces and abstract classes to help isolate the impact of those details.
- To do so by minimizing coupling in this way, our classes adhere to another class design principle known as the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).5 In essence, the DIP says that our classes should depend upon abstractions, not on concrete details.
-  But Everything is not an object so sometime we need to modify the system as discussed in the previous chapter data structure and oops. [[3. Data or Object Anti-Symmetry]].
