- Arguments are most naturally interpreted as **inputs** to a function.
    
- If you have been programming for more than a few years, you’ve likely encountered an argument that was actually an **output** rather than an input.
    
- For example:
    
    - `appendFooter(s);`
        
    - Does this function **append `s` as the footer** to something?
        
    - Or does it **append some footer to `s`**?
        
    - Is `s` an **input** or an **output**?
        
- Checking the function signature clarifies the issue:
    
    ```java
    public void appendFooter(StringBuffer report)
    ```
    
- This helps, but only at the expense of **checking the declaration** of the function.
    
- Anything that forces you to check the function signature is equivalent to a **double-take**.
    
- It’s a **cognitive break** and should be **avoided**.
	
- In other words, it would be better for `appendFooter` to be invoked as:
    
    - `report.appendFooter();`
        
- In general, **output arguments should be avoided**.
    
- If your function must **change the state** of something,
    
    - Have it **change the state of its owning object** instead.
