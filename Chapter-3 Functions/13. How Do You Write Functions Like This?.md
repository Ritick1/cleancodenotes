- **Writing software is like writing anything else** → You first **get your thoughts down**, then **refine** them.
    
- The **first draft** is often **clumsy and disorganized**, so you **wordsmith, restructure, and refine** it until it **reads well**.
    

### **Initial Code:**

- Functions start out **long and complicated**.
    
- They may have:
    
    - **Deep indentation** and **nested loops**
        
    - **Long argument lists**
        
    - **Arbitrary names**
        
    - **Duplicated code**
        
- But a **suite of unit tests** ensures that every **clumsy line of code** is covered.
    

### **Refinement Process:**

- The code is **massaged and refined** by:
    
    - **Splitting out functions**
        
    - **Changing names** for clarity
        
    - **Eliminating duplication**
        
    - **Shrinking methods** and **reordering them**
        
    - **Breaking out whole classes** if necessary
        
- All of this is done **while keeping the tests passing**.
    

### **Final Result:**

- The functions eventually follow **all the good practices** discussed in this chapter.
    
- **Nobody writes perfect code on the first attempt** → It is always a process of **iteration and refinement**.
