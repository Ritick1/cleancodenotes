  - When a function seems to need more than two or three arguments, it is likely that some of those arguments ought to be wrapped into a class of their own.
    
- Consider, for example, the difference between the two following declarations:
    
    - `Circle makeCircle(double x, double y, double radius);`
        
    - `Circle makeCircle(Point center, double radius);`
        
- Reducing the number of arguments by creating objects out of them may seem like cheating, but it’s not.
    
- When groups of variables are passed together, the way `x` and `y` are in the example above, they are likely part of a concept that deserves a name of its own.
