- Functions should do one thing.
    
- Error handling is one thing.
    
- Thus, a function that handles errors should do nothing else.
    
- This implies that if the keyword `try` exists in a function,
    
    - It should be the **very first word** in the function.
        
    - There should be **nothing after** the `catch/finally` blocks.
