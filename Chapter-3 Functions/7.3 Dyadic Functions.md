- A function with two arguments is harder to understand than a monadic function.
- For example, writeField(name) is easier to understand than writeField(output-Stream, name).
- There are times, of course, where two arguments are appropriate.
- For example,Point p = new Point(0,0); is perfectly reasonable. Cartesian points naturally take two arguments. Indeed, we’d be very surprised to see new Point(0)
