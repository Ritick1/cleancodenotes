- **Every system** is built from a **domain-specific language (DSL)** designed by programmers **to describe that system**.
    
- **Functions** act as the **verbs** of that language, while **classes** serve as the **nouns**.
    

### **Not an Outdated Approach**

- This is **not** about the old idea that **nouns and verbs in a requirements document** should directly define **classes and functions**.
    
- Instead, it reflects a **deeper truth**:
    
    - **Programming has always been the art of language design.**
        

### **How Master Programmers Think**

- They **view systems as stories** to be **told**, rather than just **programs to be written**.
    
- They use their **programming language’s features** to construct a **rich and expressive DSL** that tells that story.
    
- This DSL includes:
    
    - A **hierarchy of functions** that describe system actions.
        
    - Functions that recursively **use the DSL itself** to express their part of the story.
        

### **The True Goal of Writing Functions**

- This chapter covered the **mechanics of writing good functions** (short, well-named, and organised).
    
- But the **real goal** is to **tell the story of the system**.
    
- Your functions should **fit together cleanly** to form a **clear and precise language** that helps convey that story.
