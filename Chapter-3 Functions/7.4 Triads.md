- Functions that take three arguments are significantly harder to understand than dyads. The issues of ordering, pausing, and ignoring are more than doubled. I suggest you think
  very carefully before creating a triad.
- For example, consider the common overload of assertEquals that takes three arguments: assertEquals(message, expected, actual). How many times have you read the message and thought it was the expected? I have stumbled and paused over that particular triad many times. In fact, _every time I see it,_ I do a double-take and then learn to ignore the message.
