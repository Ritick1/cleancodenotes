- Function that do one thing cannot be reasonably divided into sections

```java

public boolean isEven(int number) {
    return number % 2 == 0;
}
```

- Here in example we cannot divide function into another function or section because it doing one thing at a time and if do so then it called restatement of its implementation.
- If the function do more then one thing at a time then the function should have sections within it.
