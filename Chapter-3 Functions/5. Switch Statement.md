- The problem of switch statement is that it always do N things and also we cannot avoid  same switch statement to be used on several places.
- The solution  to this problem is to bury the switch statement in the basement of the ABSTRACT FACTORY and never let anyone see it.

```java
public abstract class Student {
	public abstract boolean isFeesDay();
	public abstract Money calculateFees();
}

```

```java
public interface StudentFactory {
	public Student makeStudent(StudentRecord r) throws InvalidStudentType;
}
```

```java
public class StudentFactoryImpl implements StudentFactory {
	public Student makeStudent(StudentRecord r) throws InvalidStudentType {
		switch (r.grade) {
			case TWELVETH;
				return new TwelvethStuent(r);
			case TENTH;
				return new TenthStudent(r);
			default:
			 throw new InvalidStudentType(r.type)
		}
	}
}
```
