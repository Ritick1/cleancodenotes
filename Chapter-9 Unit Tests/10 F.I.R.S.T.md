Hereâ€™s the **easy crux** of the F.I.R.S.T rules you shared:

### **F.I.R.S.T Crux (Short and Clear):**

| **Letter** | **Meaning**     | **Crux**                                                                                                             |
| ---------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **F**      | Fast            | Tests must run very quickly, so you run them often and catch problems early.                                         |
| **I**      | Independent     | Each test should work alone, not depend on other tests.                                                              |
| **R**      | Repeatable      | Tests must pass anywhere (any operating system)                                                                      |
| **S**      | Self-Validating | Tests should clearly show Pass/Fail without manual checking.(means it should be simple that it will self validating) |
| **T**      | Timely          | Write tests _before_ writing the code, not after, to keep code testable and clean.                                   |

### **One-line Super Crux:**
  

ðŸ‘‰ **Good tests are Fast, Independent, Repeatable, Self-checking, and Written on time.**


**doubts**
- Explain the repeatable rule where If your tests arenâ€™t repeatable in any environment, then youâ€™ll always have an excuse for why they fail. Youâ€™ll also find yourself unable to run the tests when the environment isnâ€™t available(means use mokito don't make excuses).

- Explain the Self-Validating The tests should have a boolean output. Either they pass or fail. You should not have to read through a log file to tell whether the tests pass. You should not have to manually compare two different text files to see whether the tests pass. If the tests arenâ€™t self-validating, then failure can become subjective and running the tests can require a long manual evaluation.(means it should be simple that it will self validating, big test code is code smell).
