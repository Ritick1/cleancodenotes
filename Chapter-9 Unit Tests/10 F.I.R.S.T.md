Hereâ€™s the **easy crux** of the F.I.R.S.T rules you shared:

### **F.I.R.S.T Crux (Short and Clear):**

| **Letter** | **Meaning**     | **Crux**                                                                           |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **F**      | Fast            | Tests must run very quickly, so you run them often and catch problems early.       |
| **I**      | Independent     | Each test should work alone, not depend on other tests.                            |
| **R**      | Repeatable      | Tests must pass anywhere (laptop, QA, production), without needing special setup.  |
| **S**      | Self-Validating | Tests should clearly show Pass/Fail without manual checking.                       |
| **T**      | Timely          | Write tests _before_ writing the code, not after, to keep code testable and clean. |

### **One-line Super Crux:**
  

ðŸ‘‰ **Good tests are Fast, Independent, Repeatable, Self-checking, and Written on time.**
