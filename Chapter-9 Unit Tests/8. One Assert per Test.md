- I prefer the multiple asserts. I think the single asset rule is a good guideline. I usually try to create a domain specific testing language that supports it.
- The last thing i can say that we can use multiple asserts but we can minimized them.
- for eg for template method we use it in the query generator where we write the before part and after part and in mid we use subsitution and replace the query part where needed
- So template method is used where before part and after part remain same but mid part got changed.

**doubts**
- What is template method pattern which says We can eliminate the duplication by using the TEMPLATE METHOD pattern and putting the _given/when_ parts in the base class, and the _then_ parts in different derivatives. Or we could create a completely separate test class and put the _given_ and _when_ parts in the @Before func-tion, and the _when_ parts in each @Test function. But this seems like too much mechanism for such a minor issue. In the end, I prefer the multiple asserts in Listing 9-2.
