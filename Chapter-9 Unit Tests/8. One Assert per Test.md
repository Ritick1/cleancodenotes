- I prefer the multiple asserts. I think the single asset rule is a good guideline. I usually try to create a domain specific testing language that supports it.
- The last thing i can say that we can use multiple asserts but we can minimized them.

**doubts**
- What is template method pattern which says We can eliminate the duplication by using the TEMPLATE METHOD6 pattern and putting the _given/when_ parts in the base class, and the _then_ parts in different derivatives. Or we could create a completely separate test class and put the _given_ and _when_ parts in the @Before func-tion, and the _when_ parts in each @Test function. But this seems like too much mechanism for such a minor issue. In the end, I prefer the multiple asserts in Listing 9-2.
