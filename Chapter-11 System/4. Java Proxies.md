- Java proxies are suitable for simple situation such as wrapping or adding method call in individual object or class.
-  Some library are so powerful that it can replace the byte code also like cglib. banking system use this library because they don't have time to push build on some bug.

 doubts 
 - proxy don't provide a mechanism for specifying system-wide execution  'point' of interest. which is needed for a true aop solution
 - Above point means that proxy has some limits, that we cannot implement it in all the scenarios where as aop help us to write once and it will reflect every where in the project.
