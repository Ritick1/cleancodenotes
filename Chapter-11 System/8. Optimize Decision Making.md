### **Crux of "Optimize Decision Making" Section:**

- **Modular, decoupled architecture** enables **distributed and informed decision-making**—essential in large systems(This means team can work on separate module without knowing the whole system).
    
- It’s **better to delay decisions** until the **last responsible moment** to make them with the **best available knowledge**(This means wait until some figma or management decision has not come).
    
- Premature decisions lead to poor outcomes due to limited insight and feedback.
    
- **POJO-based, agile systems** support this by allowing flexible, just-in-time architectural choices.(It means A **POJO-based Agile system** refers to a software system built using **Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs)**, which are simple objects that don’t rely on complex frameworks or external libraries. These systems allow for **flexibility** in how they are structured and evolved, especially in Agile development where changes happen quickly.
  The phrase **“just-in-time architectural choices”** means making decisions about the system's architecture only when they are needed, rather than deciding everything upfront. This helps avoid over-engineering and allows you to build a system that adapts as you learn more throughout development)

> **In short:** Good architecture empowers teams to make smart, timely decisions—**not early ones, but informed ones**.
