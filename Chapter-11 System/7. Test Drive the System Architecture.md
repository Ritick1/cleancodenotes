### **Crux of "Test Drive the System Architecture" Section:**

- **Separation of concerns** (via aspects or similar tools) enables you to write clean, decoupled domain logic using **POJOs**.
    
- This allows you to **test-drive the architecture**(basic design)—start simple and evolve it as needed, avoiding **Big Design Up Front (BDUF)**(complex design like having interconnected part that is hard to test).
    
- Unlike buildings, software can adapt radically **during development** if designed modularly(chunks of project).
    
- Start with a minimal, flexible architecture, then **scale up** cleanly with infrastructure (like caching, security, etc.).
    
- Good architectures should **stay out of the way** and let teams focus on delivering value via user stories.
    
- **Recap**: A great architecture = modular concerns(software divide in simple module) + POJOs( help to understand the module) + lightweight aspect tools(like @transction or etc) → fully **testable and adaptable** system.(software designed to test separately all module)
    

> **In short:** Build architectures like you write clean code—small, modular, testable, and ready to evolve.
