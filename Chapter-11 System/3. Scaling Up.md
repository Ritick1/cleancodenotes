**Software systems should evolve iteratively like growing cities—don’t overbuild upfront(in advance).**  
Build only what’s needed now, then expand cleanly as requirements grow. Bad architectures (like EJB2) tightly couple code to frameworks, making testing, reuse, and scaling difficult. Clean systems maintain **separation of concerns**, enabling easy growth, refactoring, and long-term maintainability.

- EJB2 replacement is the hibernate framework because EJB2 OOPS is undermined(means one of the oops pillar is missing like inheritance).which is increasing the boiler plate code.
