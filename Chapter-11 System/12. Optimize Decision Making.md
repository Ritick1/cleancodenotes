### **Crux of "Optimize Decision Making" Section:**

- **Modular, decoupled architecture** enables **distributed and informed decision-making**—essential in large systems.
    
- It’s **better to delay decisions** until the **last responsible moment** to make them with the **best available knowledge**.
    
- Premature decisions lead to poor outcomes due to limited insight and feedback.
    
- **POJO-based, agile systems** support this by allowing flexible, just-in-time architectural choices.
    

> **In short:** Good architecture empowers teams to make smart, timely decisions—**not early ones, but informed ones**.
