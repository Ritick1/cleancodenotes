### **Crux of "Systems Need Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs)" and Conclusion:**

- **DSLs** bridge the gap between domain experts and code, making systems more expressive, readable, and aligned with business logic.
    
- A good DSL raises the abstraction level and minimizes miscommunication.
    
- **Clean systems** keep architecture noninvasive, letting **domain logic shine** through POJOs and aspect-like tools.
    
- If architecture gets in the way, **quality, agility, and productivity all suffer**.
    

> **In short:** Use POJOs and DSLs to express intent clearly and cleanly—**clarity, simplicity, and agility must drive system design**.
