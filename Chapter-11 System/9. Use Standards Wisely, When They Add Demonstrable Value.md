### **Crux of "Use Standards Wisely, When They Add Demonstrable Value":**

- **Standards are helpful** for reuse, hiring, and integration—but only when they **genuinely add value**.
    
- Many teams adopted **EJB2** blindly because it was a standard, even when **simpler solutions would have worked better**.
    
- **Don’t get distracted by hype**; always prioritize delivering real value to the customer.
    

> **In short:** Use standards only when they clearly help—**not just because they’re popular or official**.
