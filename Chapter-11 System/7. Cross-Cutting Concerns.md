### **Crux of the "Cross-Cutting Concerns" Section**:

**EJB2 tried to separate concerns like persistence, security, and transactions via configuration**, but in reality, code for these concerns still ended up scattered across many classes.

These are called **cross-cutting concerns**â€”they affect many parts of the system and break modularity.

ðŸ‘‰ **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)** later addressed this issue more effectively by allowing you to apply such concerns (like logging, security, etc.) declaratively, **without polluting business logic.**

**In short:**

> EJB2 partially addressed cross-cutting concerns, but true modularity came later with AOP.


doubts 
- what modularity aop comes with?
- example1 :- if i am putting the log on the every method of the project and but i want that some sum method which is not having the log in it, so with the help of aop i can add the separate logic which will add the this at runtime. 
- example2 :- transactional how it work. it work with help of the aop, it convert the the main with the proxy classes. 
- some library are so powerful that it can replace the byte code also like cglib. banking system use this library because they don't have time to push build on some bug.
