### **Crux of the AspectJ Section:**

- **AspectJ** is the **most powerful tool** for handling cross-cutting concerns using true modularity via aspects.
    
- While **Spring AOP and JBoss AOP** cover most common needs (80–90%), AspectJ offers **deeper control and flexibility**.
    
- **Downside**: Requires learning new syntax, tools, and patterns.
    
- **Solution**: AspectJ now supports an **annotation-based style** (using Java 5+), which integrates well with Spring and is easier for most teams to adopt.
    

> **In short:** AspectJ is powerful but complex; Spring's annotation-based support helps make it more accessible.
