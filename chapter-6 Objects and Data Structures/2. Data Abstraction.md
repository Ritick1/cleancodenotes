- Abstraction is not that you put the getter or setter and make the variables private and it also not about make the interface and hide the implementation but its about the way you represent the data that an object contain.
- for e.g
```java
// it does not hide implementation
public class Point {

	public double x;

	public double y;

}
```

```java

// it hide the implementation and in way that we don't know that what object it contain.
public interface Point {

	double getX();

	double getY();

	void setCartesian(double x, double y);

	double getR();

	double getTheta();

	void setPolar(double r, double theta);

}
```
