- final String outputDir = ctxt.getOptions().getScratchDir().getAbsolutePaths(); it is called the train wrecks.
- If they are object than there is violation of the law of demeter and if they are like String outputDir = ctxt.getOptions.getScratchDir.getAbsolutePaths; then it a data structure and it is not the violation of the law of demeter
- Difference btw the data structure and object orient is that if the object has no pillar of oops(means inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation) and it has no logic no rule behind its method means its a data structure which help us to transfer data.
