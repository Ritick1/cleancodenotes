- If you decide to write comments then spend the time necessary to make sure it is the best comment you can write
-  Just not because a process requires the comment(**means any code that check you comments are correct or not**) or you feel you should write the comments for everything is the hack you are doing.
- If you do this u just left behind the garbage of comments
