- In old days when the languages are facing the issues of remembering type then we take a unnecessary step.
- The step was to enforce the encoding of variables like basic and fortran
- But now in modern language like java, the programmers do not need to encode the variable because compiler was there to enforce the type
- For  e.g 
```java
PhoneNumber phoneString;
// name not changed when type changes!
```
