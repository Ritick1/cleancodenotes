-  We should remove the difficulty from the names by not using the difficult names 
- Always use the intended meaning of the names rather then difficult names
- for e.g 

1. There is object of the account class we should name it accounts rather then accountList if its not defined as List<>.
	

2. Here below we can clearly se the lower case l and upper case o which creating the difficulty to understand the diff between the 0(zero) and 1(one).
```java

int l = 0;
int a = l;

if ( O == l )

a = O1;

else

l = 01;
```
