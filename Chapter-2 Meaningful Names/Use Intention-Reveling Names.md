- We should avoid the implicitly of the code and define every thing explicit in the code
- for e.g

```java
public void phrase(){ 

	int i = 0;
	 System.out.println("the phrase is " + i);
	 
}
```

- Here the method name is implicitly defined, we cannot able to predict the nature of the method that its creating or updating or getting something.
- int i is also not clear that what is its purpose.
- clear e.g

```java
public void getPhraseCount(){ 

	int phraseCount = 0;
	 System.out.println("the phrase count is " + phraseCount);
	 
}
```
