- Method should have verb or verb phrase.
- `Verb :- They are actions words that describe what someone or something does for example 'run', 'eat' and 'sleep' are verbs.`
- For e.g -> postPayment, deletePage or save.
- Accessors, mutators and predicates should be named for their value and prefixed with get, set and is according to the java bean standard
- We do not need to overload the constructors instead make the constructor private and use the static factory method.
- For e.g ObjectMapperUtils class will have private constructor and we are using there method which are static.
- There are many type of the class pojo, data structure(record), utils, etc 
- In pojo we define the variables as private and we make the action method that can be static or not static 
- In data structure we make the variables public and method also public
- In utils we do not make the object of the class all the method are by default static.
