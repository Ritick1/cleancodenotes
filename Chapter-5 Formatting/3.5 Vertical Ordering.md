- The Vertical Ordering means the function which is called should be below the function which is calling.

```java
// This is the function that is calling the greet function
void main() {
    // Calling the greet function
    greet();
    
    System.out.println("Program ended.");
}

// This is the function that is called
void greet() {
    System.out.println("Hello, welcome to the program!");
}

```

- **Another Example would be, if the a() function is called by both b() and c(), then a() should be placed below them. In this case, since c() is the last function that calls a(), we place a() below c()**
