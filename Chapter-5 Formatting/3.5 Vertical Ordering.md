- The Vertical Ordering means the function which is called should be below the function which is calling.

```java
// This is the function that is calling the greet function
void main() {
    // Calling the greet function
    greet();
    
    System.out.println("Program ended.");
}

// This is the function that is called
void greet() {
    System.out.println("Hello, welcome to the program!");
}

```
