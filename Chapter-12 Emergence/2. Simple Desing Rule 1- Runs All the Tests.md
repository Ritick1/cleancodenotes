- **Core Idea**: A design is only valid if it can be verified through tests.
    
- **Why it matters**:
    
    - Testable code tends to have **low coupling** and **high cohesion**.
        
    - Writing tests leads to **smaller, more focused classes**.
        
    - Testing encourages better use of **DIP**, **abstraction**, and **dependency injection**.
        
- **Impact**: Improves reliability and pushes toward cleaner designs automatically.
