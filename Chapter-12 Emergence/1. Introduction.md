- **Premise**: Great design can _emerge_ through simple rules rather than being fully pre-planned.
    
- **Four Simple Design Rules (Kent Beck)**:
    
    1. Runs all tests ✅
        
    2. No duplication ♻️
        
    3. Expresses intent 💬
        
    4. Minimizes classes and methods 🧩
        
- Following these rules helps naturally apply principles like **SRP** and **DIP**.
