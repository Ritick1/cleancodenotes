- **Duplication is harmful** – increases bugs, work, and complexity.
    
- Types of duplication:
    
    - Identical/similar code
        
    - Logic repeated in different places
        
- **Solutions**:
    
    - Extract methods to remove repetition.
        
    - Use patterns like **Template Method** to abstract shared logic.
        
- **Big Insight**: Removing even _tiny_ duplication leads to **SRP enforcement** and **code reuse**, which reduces system complexity.
