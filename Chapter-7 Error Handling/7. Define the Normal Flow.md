- It's good to separate the business logic and error handling but in some cases developer put business logic in the after abortion of the flow which is in catch block.
- But to overcome this is issue we can put special case pattern here which say use the default value instead.

```java
try {

	MealExpenses expenses = expenseReportDAO.getMeals(employee.getID());

	m_total += expenses.getTotal();

} catch(MealExpensesNotFound e) {

	m_total += getMealPerDiem();

}
```
  
```java
public class PerDiemMealExpenses implements MealExpenses {

	public int getTotal() {

	// return the per diem default

	}

}
```
